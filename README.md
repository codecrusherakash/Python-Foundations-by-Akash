# Python-Foundations-by-Akash
Daily Python logic, Raw practice ,not perfect but consistent one. 
Python Practice.<br>
This repo isn’t here to impress anyone.<br>
It’s not a project. It’s not perfect. It’s not made for claps.<br>
It’s where I show up, daily,to train **my brain**,fight my doubts, and build the one skill that actually matters.<br>
What's Inside:<br>
This is my **unfiltered Python practice**, the kind no one talks about, but everyone needs.<br>
Mistakes that I debug, fix, and learn from<br>
Why This Repo Exists:<br>
Because tutorials don’t make you good. <br>
**Daily, deliberate practice does.**<br>
I’m not waiting for “the right time.”  <br>
I will be using Python to build the foundation for:<br>
- Backend logic<br>
- DSA & coding interviews<br>
- Real world automation<br>
- AI/ML (later, when I’ve earned it)<br>
This Is My Mind Gym<br>
Every file is a rep.<br>
Every bug I fix is a win.<br>  
Every commit is me saying:<br>
>“I may not be there yet but I’m not the guy who quits.”<br><
Respect to anyone else grinding in silence.<br>No shortcuts, Just showing up.
